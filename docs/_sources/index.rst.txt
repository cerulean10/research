Polly's Research Homepage
=========================

Greetings!  I am a neuroscientist with expertise in imaging.  

Currently, I provide operational support for *genomic medicine programs* at the Veterans Health Administration.  I am also involved in the development of quantitative imaging pipelines for lung cancer.  

Previously, my work involved mapping human brain function. This includes studies on somatosensation, plasticity, visual imagery (3D vs. 2D environments), language and memory.

These pages provide examples of my :doc:`current <current_work>` and :doc:`past <previous_work>` imaging work. They also contain general information on :doc:`brain imaging techniques <imaging_modalities>` as well as links to my :doc:`CV <cvpage>` and :doc:`publications <publications>`.
