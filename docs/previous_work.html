<h1>Previous Imaging Work<a class="headerlink" href="#previous-imaging-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>From 1999-2012, I researched brain function in living humans. This included work in somatosensation, visual imagery (3D immersion), neuroplasticity, language and memory.  For details please see my <a class="reference internal" href="cvpage.html"><span class="doc">CV</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="publications.html"><span class="doc">publications.</span></a></p>
<p>Below is a summary of 2 studies I published, one related to word generation and another to neuroplasticity.</p>
<div class="section" id="language-in-the-brain">
<h2>Language in the Brain<a class="headerlink" href="#language-in-the-brain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Classical lesion-based models of language propose that verbal processing follows a strict sequence. For example, when a word is read there is a “serial” flow of information (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>) beginning with letter decoding (visual cortex) to phonological decoding and comprehension (angular gyrus and Wernicke&#8217;s area) to motor program creation and finally an utterance (Broca&#8217;s area and motor cortex).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Fig 1:</strong> Lesion based models of language describe brain processing as a strict, <em>serial</em>, flow of information.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Today, imaging with PET and fMRI demonstrate a broader &#8220;network&#8221; of brain areas supporting language. Including ventral occipital, lateral and basal temporal as well as inferior and medial frontal areas. <em>But what is the sequence of brain activity involved and how does it compare with the serial nature of classic models?</em></p>
<p>To better understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of word generation we used <a class="reference internal" href="imaging_modalities.html"><span class="doc">MEG and MRI</span></a> to measure brain response as subjects performed a word-stem completion task. Specifically, subjects were visually presented 3-letter word stems (i.e. &#8220;STA&#8221;) and asked to covertly generate complete words as MEG was recorded.</p>
<p><em>We found that although initial activity is serial, after ~250ms post-stimulus multiple areas were active simultaneously.</em> (<strong>Fig 2</strong>) Thus, brain processing supporting language is more appropriately described as <em>distributed and parallel</em>, rather than <em>serial</em> as emphasized by classical models.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/wordgen.jpg"><img alt="_images/wordgen.jpg" src="_images/wordgen.jpg" style="width: 624.0px; height: 468.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Fig 2:</strong> Brain response supporting word generation, as revealed by MEG, is more appropriately described as distributed and parallel.</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In summary, the current study found a progression of activation during word-stem completion, beginning in bilateral visual areas moving forward to ventral temporal, temporal-parietal and finally prefrontal regions lateralizing to the left hemisphere. Importantly, in the final stages, there was <strong>sustained co-activation</strong> of all of the above areas. This sustained activation may permit multiple sources of lexical information (i.e., phonemic, orthographic, and semantic) to converge (possibly within Broca&#8217;s area) and constrain verbal response selection.  This initial serial but subsequent distributed and parallel processing demonstrates that classical models require modification.</p>

<div class="section" id="neuroplasticity-in-the-brain">
<h2>Neuroplasticity in the Brain<a class="headerlink" href="#neuroplasticity-in-the-brain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to language, I have conducted work investigating neuroplasticity. The following show data from Dhond et al 2012.</p>
<p>Brain response to simple somatosensory stimuli follows a characteristic pattern. However, injury can affect these normal response patterns and even result in lasting changes.  In the field of neuroscience (and biology in general...) this phenomenon is called &#8220;plasticity&#8221;. Neural plasticity involves the central nervous system&#8217;s ability to change or adapt (sometimes maladapt) to a changing peripheral environment or to bodily injury. This is exemplified by changes that occur with median nerve entrapment (injury) more commonly known as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).</p>
<p>In Dhond et al 2012 MEG was used to spatiotemporally map differences in brain response to digit stimulation (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>) in healthy volunteers (HV) vs. patients with carpal tunnels syndrome (CTS).</p>
<p>Brain activity was evaluated for changes (1) Somatotopy, i.e. changes in spatial representation; (2) timing of cortical responses, i.e. the N20 peak; and (3) changes in the power of power of endogenous cortical rhythms, i.e. alpha and beta rhythms.</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/digitstim.jpg"><img alt="_images/digitstim.jpg" src="_images/digitstim.jpg" style="width: 576.0px; height: 377.4px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Fig 3:</strong> Healthy volunteers (HV) and CTS patients underwent electrical stimulation of their digits while MEG was recorded.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In short we found 3 neural markers associated with focal nerve entrapment in CTS</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Marker 1</strong>- Altered digit somatotopy in S1 cortex <strong>(Fig 4)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Marker 2</strong>- Delayed timing of initial cortical response in S1 cortex (M20) <strong>(Fig 5)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Marker 3</strong>- Altered sensory rhythms in S1 cortex (alpha and beta rhythms) <strong>(Fig 6)</strong></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Fig 4:</strong> Digit representation in somatosensory cortex is blurred for CTS patients vs. healthy volunteers (HV).</span></p>

<div class="figure align-left" id="id5">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/marker2.jpg"><img alt="_images/marker2.jpg" src="_images/marker2.jpg" style="width: 672.0px; height: 456.4px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Fig 5:</strong> The timing of initial brain response (N20 peak) is later in CTS vs. HV.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="figure align-left" id="id6">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/marker3.jpg"><img alt="_images/marker3.jpg" src="_images/marker3.jpg" style="width: 672.0px; height: 463.4px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Fig 6:</strong> CTS patients demonstrate decreased SI beta and alpha power in comparison to HV when their digits (fingers) are stimulated.</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Smaller cortical source separation for D2 and D3 in CTS patients vs. healthy controls supports the hypothesis that ongoing paresthesias promote blurring of median nerve-innervated digit representations through Hebbian plasticity mechanisms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, S1 M20 latencies for median nerve-innervated digits were longer in carpal tunnel syndrome; thus, slower peripheral nerve conduction velocity corresponds to greater delays in the latency of the first cortical response.</p>
<p>Finally, CTS patients demonstrated attenuated beta response that correlated with increasing paresthesia ratings. One explanation is that ongoing paresthesias in median nerve-innervated digits render their corresponding sensorimotor cortical areas ‘busy’, thus reducing their capacity to process external stimulation.</p>
<p>These MEG measures are novel markers of neuroplasticity in carpal tunnel syndrome and could be used to study central changes that may occur following clinical intervention.</p>
